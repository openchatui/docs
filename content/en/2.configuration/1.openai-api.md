![Connections overview](/connections/starting.png)

Connect to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/); models are automatically synced across APIs. You can also use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) GGUFs.

## OpenAI Compatible APIs

![OpenAI compatible providers](/connections/openai-apis.png)

Use this section to connect to OpenAI-compatible providers. Common options include:

- **OpenAI**: Create an API key in your OpenAI account and paste it here. See [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
- **OpenRouter**: Use your OpenRouter key to access multiple upstream models through a single interface. See [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

Configure the provider, add your API key, and select your preferred default model.

## Ollama

![Ollama connection](/connections/ollama-api.png)

Connect to a local Ollama instance. Enter the base URL if different from the default, then click **Test connection** to validate and save the configuration.

### Download models

![Ollama download models](/connections/ollama-download.png)

Browse available models and download them locally so they are ready to use.

### Delete models

![Ollama delete models](/connections/ollama-delete.png)

Remove models you no longer need to free up disk space.

## Hugging Face (GGUF)

Download GGUF models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) â€” see the [GGUF models catalog](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gguf). Use them with Ollama by creating a model from a GGUF via a Modelfile. Models are large; ensure enough disk space.
